  Sharing winter experiences. A home exchange platform for skiers and snowboarders.
</p>

## Description
You live in a ski town and have a great location. Yeah you ski a ton locally, but you also want to explore other areas that are included on your Ikon or Epic passes.

The problem? Lodging costs.  To spend an overnight at places like Telluride and Jackson Hole means paying for a hotel or an AirBnB in town, which during ski season, can be really expensive. Meanwhile, your place sits empty.  What if there was another way?

Snome (‘snow homes’) is a proposed home exchange platform for ski towns. Skiers, snowboarders, and other winter enthusiasts can find cool new places to stay, and share their own, for a true win-win.
